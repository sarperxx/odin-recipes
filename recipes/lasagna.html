    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna (plural “lasagne”) is a flat and expanded pasta sheet, traditionally made in Italy with Parmigiano-Reggiano
        (Parmesan cheese), Béchamel sauce (white sauce), and ragù (a meat-based sauce). Despite the traditional form still
        being popular, lasagna has taken on many different recipes over the years.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1clove garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li> 
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li> 
        <li>1 cup spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>6 purchased precooked or oven-ready lasagna noodles (each about 7x3 inches)</li>
        <li>1 container (12 ounces) reduced-fat cottage cheese (1 1/2 cups)</li> 
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (4 ounces)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li> 
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 400°. Peel and finely chop the garlic. Cook the beef and garlic in the skillet over medium heat
            about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the beef is brown; drain.</li>
        <li>Stir the Italian seasoning and spaghetti sauce into the beef. Spread 1/4 cup of the beef mixture in the ungreased
            square pan.</li>
        <li>Top with 2 noodles, placing them so they do not overlap or touch the sides of the pan because they will expand as
            they bake. Spread about 1/2 cup of the remaining beef mixture over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Spread about 1/2 cup of the cottage cheese over the beef mixture. Sprinkle with about 1/3 cup of the mozzarella
            cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layering twice more, beginning with 2 more noodles and following directions in steps 3 and 4 Sprinkle with
            the parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake 30 minutes. Carefully remove the foil, and continue baking about 10 minutes longer
            or until lasagna is bubbly around the edges and looks very hot. Let stand 10 minutes, so the lasagna will become
            easier to cut and serve.</li>
    </ol>
